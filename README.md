## Hey there! 👋

I’m [Immanuel Antony Jeyam B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/immanuel-antony-jeyam), a **Full-Stack Flutter Developer** based in India.

I design and build scalable, efficient applications to solve real-world problems.

If I have an idea or face an issue, I build the solution.

My main tech stack is **Flutter**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. Recently, I've been diving deeper into **React.js** and **Python** for AI integrations. My favorite tools are **Figma** for design, and **Linux (Ubuntu)** for my development environment.

I’ve developed apps like *AttendZone* and *FertiOptimizer*, but my favorite project is **[Ubuntu Text Extractor](https://github.com/IMMANUEL-88/ubuntu_text_extractor)**— a text extractor I built as an alternative to Windows PowerToys Text Extractor, designed specifically for Ubuntu.

If you want to collaborate or discuss, feel free to reach out!
